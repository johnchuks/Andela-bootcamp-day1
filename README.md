This learning outcome shows the implementation of object oriented programming taking advantage of some oop concepts.

 A superclass called bankAccount was created with arguments of first name, last name, and balance. Sub classes savingsAccount and 

 currentAccount were also created and they inherited the properties  from the superclass bankAccount.

 Each of the subclasses were given unique account numbers. The length of account number for the savingsAccount class was 8 digits and t

 the length of the currentAccount class was 9 digits.


 new objects were created that inherited properties from the subclasses savingsAccount and currentAccount.
